      <description>Overview I work primarily at the intersection of natural science, social science, and public policy with a focus on coupled human-natural systems and on the ways in which scientific knowledge and uncertainty affect policy decisions about the environment.
My current work makes extensive use of agent-based models to simulate the ways that small changes in behavior at the individual level can add up to large-scale shifts at the level of the whole population, giving what is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;emergent phenomena.</description>

      <description>I am currently pursuing research in five areas:
  Water Conservation in US cities: A multidisciplinary analysis of hydrological, political, and social dimensions of water management and conservation policy in US metropolitan areas.
  Environmental stress and human migration in southwestern Bangladesh: A comparison of co-evolving natural and human landscapes in a physically and culturally diverse context.
  Agricultural decision-making and adaptation to precipitation trends in Sri Lanka: Studying the impacts of water stress on paddy farmers in the Mahaweli River Watershed of Sri Lanka and understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain adaptive responses.</description>

      <description>Students working with me are engaged in a variety of projects to combine knowledge about the physical environment and social, political, and economic conditions. This can include analysis of remote-sensing imagery from satellites, working with GIS databases, developing agent-based models, and conducting spatiotemporal statistical analysis.
Students write and publish papers, often as first-author, in scientific journals and present research results at national and international conferences.
Current Students   Kelsea Best is researching connections between environmental change, livelihoods, and population movement in Bangladesh.</description>
