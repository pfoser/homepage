    <h1>What Students Do</h1>
    <p>Students working with me are engaged in a variety of projects to combine knowledge
about the physical environment and social, political, and economic conditions.
This can include analysis of remote-sensing imagery from satellites, working with
GIS databases, developing agent-based models, and conducting spatiotemporal
statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Students write and publish papers, often as first-author, in scientific journals
and present research results at national and international conferences.</p>
<h2 id="current-students">Current Students</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Kelsea Best</strong> is researching connections between environmental change,
livelihoods, and population movement in Bangladesh. Kelsea applies machine
learning to survey data to identify patterns in the characteristics of
people who relocate and will use those insights to develop agent-based models
to simulate migration patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pam Hoover</strong> is studying the environmental impact of reading documents
electronically versus printing them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>David Knorr</strong> is investigating connections between gentrification and access to
public transit in Nashville. David uses GIS and other tools to apply advanced
spatio-temporal statistical methods to studying patterns in home sales and
prices and ridership on public buses. He will use the results of this research
to develop an agent-based model of the impact of gentrification on the
ability to conduct the activities of daily living by people with low income
and limited access to personal vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chris Tasich</strong> is studying governance of vulnerable landscapes in Bangladesh.
Chris has developed a model of sediment deposition in intertidal
lands along the tidal channels in coastal Bangladesh. He is applying
agent-based models of local decision-making to study how communities might
make use of different approaches to managing vulnerable lands in the face
of sea-level rise and other environmental change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recently-graduated-students">Recently Graduated Students</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://qcnr.usu.edu/directory/burchfield_emily">Emily K. Burchfield</a></strong>
graduated with her Ph.D. in 2017.
Her graduate studies focused on combining intensive computational methods of
geospatial analysis with satellite remote-sensing imagery and on-the-ground
research on farmers coping with water scarcity in Bangladesh. Emily made
extensive use of Bayesian statistical methods to analyze her data and developed
agent-based models of the economic and social impacts of farmers' decision processes.</p>
<p>Emily is now an Assistant Professor at Utah State University&rsquo;s Department
of Environment and Society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://johnjnay.com">John J. Nay</a></strong> graduated with his Ph.D. in 2017.
His graduate studies focused on computational decision science, combining
machine learning, behavioral economics, and field work in Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh. John applied machine learning tools and agent-based modeling
to a wide variety of problems, from identifying the strategies real people
use in playing  games to analyzing law and policy.</p>
<p>While he was still a graduate student, John founded a company,
<a href="https://www.skoposlabs.com">Skopos Labs</a>, which applies artificial
intelligence to predicting which bills before the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>John divides his time between being CEO of Skopos Labs and
a postdoctoral fellowship in legal informatics at the
New York University Law School.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Laura Benneyworth</strong> graduated with her Ph.D. in 2016.
Her graduate studies focused on integrating detailed chemical analysis
of water quality in Bangladesh with social-scientific research on people&rsquo;s
perceptions of water quality and the sources of water they use.</p>
<pre><code>Laura discovered that rural households in Bangladesh often have
great difficulty finding safe water to drink and often don't even
realize how poor the quality of their water is. These difficulties
are far greater than one would guess from the official figures on
water availablity.

After graduating, Laura has worked as a GIS analyst for the Tennessee
Department of Transportation and as a GIS consultant.
